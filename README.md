# React Covid Tracker

Project 2 built for the project a week challenge from [Florin Pop]("https://github.com/florinpop17"). Being built with React and TailwindCSS, using the [MathDroid Covid 19 API]("https://github.com/mathdroid/covid-19-api").

You are given the global Confirmed, Recovered, and Death numbers, as well as you can select a country from a dropdown menu which will then show you the details for that country. If Canada is selected, and additional dropdown is presented where you can also break it down by province.

Future versions of this app will include:

- graph/chart data
- save multiple countries which automatically load up on page load
- a sleeker design
- region/state/county/province breakdowns for all countries
